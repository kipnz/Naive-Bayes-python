This Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm classifies test and learns off the excel file trg.csv and then gives an average accuracy in classifying the data using 
10-fold cross validation.

once this is done the file then takes the instances from the tst.csv file and classifies them using the learning from the initial csv file.

The Naive Bayes algorithm is a probablistic machine learning algorithm that is good at text classification.

the data in the csv files is medical data and the classes are A, B, V, E.
